# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the master branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # Runs a single command using the runners shell
      - name: Run a one-line script
        run: echo Hello, world!

      # Runs a set of commands using the runners shell
      - name: Run a multi-line script
        run: |
          echo Add other actions to build,
          echo test, and deploy your project.
          
      # set script for build project?
      - name: Build and Deploy
        uses: JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@4.0.0 # 第二步是构建和部署，使用的 action 是JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action。
        env:
          ACCESS_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.commit_secret }}  # must provide a access token.
          BRANCH: gh-pages # branch name of save your new file after build.
          FOLDER: dist  # folder name, when your run build and generate files.
          BUILD_SCRIPT: npm install && npm run build # 第二步需要四个环境变量，分别为 GitHub 密钥、发布分支、构建成果所在目录、构建脚本。其中，只有 GitHub 密钥是秘密变量，需要写在双括号里面，其他三个都可以直接写在文件里。
